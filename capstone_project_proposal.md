#**Yelp Restaurant Photo Classification (Kaggle Competition)**

##Problem
In this capstone project I aim to build a classification model that assigns multiple labels to photos of restaurants. The capstone project is based on a Kaggle Competition provided by Yelp company. 
Currently, restaurant labels are manually selected by Yelp users when they submit a review. Selecting the labels is optional, leaving some restaurants un- or only partially-categorized. But Yelp’s users upload an enormous amount of photos every day alongside their written reviews. This data set of restaurants photos can be turned into multiple tags using an automatic classification model. 

##Client
Yelp is an American multinational corporation headquartered in San Francisco, California. It develops, hosts and markets Yelp.com and the Yelp mobile app, which publish crowd-sourced reviews about local businesses.

##Data
The data set for the project is Yelp users’ uploaded images of restaurants and corresponding labels (or business ids). The Data Files can be downloaded from site: (https://www.kaggle.com/c/yelp-restaurant-photo-classification/data).
